# Initial Setup

- Make sure that you have `npm` installed on your machine. The version used is `6.14.8`.
- Check if `npm start` works from the repo folder. If it doesn't, follow the below steps.

- Install Create-React-App using npm: `npm install -g create-react-app` 

- Install the required modules using `npm install`
  - For some reason, `axios` fails to install via this approach, manually install it by typing: `npm install axios --save`
  - Similarly, install `react-router-dom` as `npm install react-router-dom --save`
- Start the server by typing `npm start`. This should open up the default web browser with the webpage up.
